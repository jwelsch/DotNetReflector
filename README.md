# DotNetReflector

A library that provides classes to wrap some of the `System.Reflection` classes.

## Concept

The classes in this library are a thin wrapper around some of the `System.Reflection` classes. The idea is to use these wrapper classes to mock out the otherwise sometimes tough to deal with `System.Reflection` classes.
